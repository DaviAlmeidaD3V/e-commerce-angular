# Project Description

The project was developed with the goal of learning more about data flow in a web application, combining both the backend and frontend efficiently. Throughout the development, I aimed to understand how different technologies and tools can interact to create a complete and scalable application.

## Backend

For the **backend**, I used **Node.js** along with the **Express.js** framework to build the API that manages requests and interacts with the database. To ensure security and access control, I implemented **JWT (JSON Web Token)**, enabling authentication and authorization in a simple and effective way. Additionally, **Joi** was used for data validation in user data, ensuring that user inputs are correct and protected. The database was structured using **MySQL**, providing a robust and efficient relational data management system. **CORS** was also configured to ensure that the application is secure by allowing or blocking requests from different origins.

## Frontend

On the **frontend**, I opted for the **Angular** framework, which facilitates the creation of a dynamic and reactive user interface. To enhance the user experience, I used **Angular Material**, which offers pre-styled and responsive components, allowing for the construction of a modern and intuitive interface. I also implemented **SwiperJS** to create interactive sliders, improving application navigation and providing a more pleasant layout.

## Data Flow Integration

The integration between the **backend** and **frontend** was done smoothly, ensuring that data was passed securely and efficiently from the API to the user interface. The main goal was to ensure that the data flow was well-structured and that the user experience was optimized.

## Conclusion

In summary, this project not only provided me the opportunity to deepen my knowledge of the mentioned technologies but also allowed me to understand how they can work together to build a functional and scalable application.
